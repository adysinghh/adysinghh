Im building practical AI products - **LLM agents (tool-use + eval)** and **on-device ML**.

- Currently working on agent reliability + testing harnesses • Personilisation • mobile/on-device experiences (Im quite bullish on on-device manily for B2B and some intersecting areas in B2C) • applied computer vision (VTON)
- Interested in anything that would make life/ work experinces more efficent and intesting! retrieval systems; and higly intrested in working towards AGI (working on few parts!)!
